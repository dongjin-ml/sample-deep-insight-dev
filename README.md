## Are You Facing These Challenges?

### 에이전트 설계, 어디서부터 시작해야 할지 고민이신가요? (Struggling with Agent Architecture?)

Deep Insight provides a **proven hierarchical architecture** with Coordinator, Planner, Supervisor, and specialized tool agents. Start with a working production-grade system and customize from there—no need to design from scratch.

### 프로덕션급 성능의 에이전트, 어떻게 만들어야 할지 막막하신가요? (Need Production-Grade Performance?)

Get **production-grade multi-agent workflows** out of the box with prompt caching, streaming responses, token tracking, and battle-tested performance patterns. Deploy with confidence using architecture validated in real-world scenarios.

### 민감한 데이터를 안전하게 처리하고 싶으신가요? (Concerned About Data Security?)

Deploy Deep Insight in **your own AWS VPC** for complete data isolation and control. All data processing happens within your secure VPC environment, with Amazon Bedrock API calls staying in AWS infrastructure—never exposed to the public internet.

## Why Deep Insight?

Transform complex data analysis into automated insights using hierarchical multi-agent systems built on Strands SDK and Amazon Bedrock.

- **🤖 Advanced Multi-Agent Architecture** - Hierarchical workflow with Coordinator, Planner, Supervisor, and specialized tool agents
- **🎨 Full Customization & Control** - Modify agents, prompts, and workflows with complete code access
- **🧠 Flexible Model Selection** - Choose different Claude models for each agent (Sonnet 4, Haiku 4, etc.) via simple .env configuration
- **💻 Custom Code Interpreter** - Flexible code execution from local Python to Fargate-based containers with your own Docker image
- **📊 Transparency & Verifiability** - Reports with calculation methods, sources, and reasoning processes
- **🔒 Enterprise-Grade Security** - From local development to 100% private VPC with Bedrock AgentCore Runtime
- **⚡ Production Scalability** - Concurrent processing with AgentCore MicroVM and auto-scaling Fargate containers
- **🚀 Beyond Reporting** - Extend to any agent use case: shopping, support, log analysis, and more

## Quick Start

Deep Insight provides two deployment options to match your needs.

### Self-Hosted Deployment

Run agents locally or in your VPC with full control:
- ✅ Complete code access to agents, prompts, and workflows
- ✅ Rapid iteration during development (no rebuild required)
- ✅ Simple setup in ~10 minutes

**Get Started**: [`./self-hosted/`](./self-hosted/) | 📖 [Self-Hosted README](./self-hosted/README.md)

### Managed AgentCore Deployment

Production deployment using AWS Bedrock AgentCore Runtime with VPC Private Mode:
- ✅ Bedrock AgentCore Runtime hosting Strands Agent
- ✅ Custom Code Interpreter (ECR + ALB + Fargate)
- ✅ 100% private network (VPC endpoints, no public internet)

**Get Started**: [`./managed-agentcore/`](./managed-agentcore/) | 📖 [Managed AgentCore README](./managed-agentcore/README.md)

## Deployment Options

| | Self-Hosted | Managed AgentCore |
|---|-------------|-------------------|
| Setup Time | ~10 minutes | ~45 minutes |
| Agent Hosting | Local/EC2 | Bedrock AgentCore Runtime |
| Code Execution | Local Python | Custom Code Interpreter (Fargate) |
| Network | Your choice | 100% Private VPC |
| Best For | Development, Testing | Production, Enterprise |

## Demo

### Fresh Food Sales Data Analysis

> **Task**: "Create a sales performance report for Moon Market. Analyze from sales and marketing perspectives, generate charts and extract insights, then create a docx file. The analysis target is the `./data/Dat-fresh-food-claude.csv` file."
>
> **Workflow**: Input (CSV data file: `Dat-fresh-food-claude.csv`) → Process (Natural language prompt: "Analyze sales performance, generate charts, extract insights") → Output (DOCX report with analysis, visualizations, and marketing insights)
